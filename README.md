Input the beer name you had at the brewery and rate the beer from 1 to 5. With a rating of 1 being your least favorite and rating of 5 being a most have again. The application will save the your input in a text file so that you can keep track of the craft beer you have tasted as well as the brewery you have visited

3. The program will return the results based on the user input. For example Enter Berwery name will prompt the user for a name. The API will return the results


4. The user will then enter the name of the beer they had at the brewery and their rating (1-5).


5. The user will be asked if they want to enter another beer and rating. If the answer is "no", the user will be asked if they want to search for another berwery.
